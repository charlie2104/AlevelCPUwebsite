					<h2 class = "centered">RAM</h2>
					<p class = "centered">RAM stands for Random Access Memory, it stores data needed by the CPU for the tasks it is preforming. It has a quite large capacity compared to ROM and Cache, generally around 2gb-16gb. If we increase the size of RAM we will be able to do more proccesses without using the hard drive as virtual memory, thus increasing capacity increases the performance of the computer. RAM is volatile memory so when the computer is turned off it looses all its data.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "collum_2">
					<h2 class = "centered">Cache</h2>
					<p class = "centered">Cache is very similar to RAM, it stores data needed by the CPU for the tasks being carried out. It is built into the CPU and has a very small capacity, around 8kb-64kb. However as it is so close to the CPU it is alot faster than RAM. Therefore the most frequently used data and instructions will be stored in here for example keyobard shortcuts such as Ctrl+s. Similarly to RAM it is volatile so when the computer is turned off it looses all of its data.</p>

					<h2 class = "centered">Registers</h2>
					<p class = "centered">A register is something built into the CPU that stores a peice of data or an instruction. There are 5 types further explained below. Registers need to be able to hold at least the amount fo bits the computer uses, for example 64 bits. There are different types that store different things. A register will work together with RAM or cache as it will store data or instructions from a memory location on the RAM or Cache. Registers are very important. </p>
