			<p class = "centered" id = "partsOfCPU">the CPU consists of 3 main parts that communicate with one another via Busses to execute a given task. The 3 main parts of the CPU are: The arithmetic logic unit(ALU), the Control Unit and the Memory</p>

					<h2 class = "centered">Memory</h2>
					<p class = "centered">Computer memory is any physical device capable of storing information temporarily or permanently. The three main types of memory that the CPU interacts with are: RAM, Registers and Cache these are further explained in the memory section.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "collum_2">
					<h2 class = "centered">Arithmetic Logic Unit</h2>
					<p class = "centered">The role of the Arithmetic Logic Unit is to handle all of the logical and arithmetic processing inside the CPU. It performs calculations and comparisons. For example it handles all boolean operations for example AND, OR, NOT.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "collum_3">
					<h2 class = "centered">Control Unit</h2>
					<p class = "centered">The Control Unit ensures that data goes to and comes from the correct place at the correct time. It is in charge of controlling the way that data moves around the CPU. It also controls and monitors the input and output devices.</p>
