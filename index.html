				<p id = "CPUdef" class = "centered">The CPU is what many people refer to as the brains of the computer system. It is a chip on the motherboard that handles all the processes and tasks the computer wants to carry out. It contains many different parts that have different jobs most of which are listed on this website. The CPU carries out tasks using the Fetch Decode an Execute cycle further explained below. </p>

			<div class = "collums">
				<h1 class = "centered" id = "CycleTitle">Fetch Decode Execute cycle</h1>
				<div class = "collum_1">
					<h2>Fetch</h2>
					<p>This is the part of the cycle where the CPU fetches all the data and instructions needed for the process to be carried out</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "collum_2">
					<h2>Decode</h2>
					<p>In this part of the cycle the CPU decodes all the data it fetched in the previous stage and makes sense of what to do with it</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "collum_3">
					<h2>Execute</h2>
					<p>Finally the CPU takes all the data and instructions it just decoded and executes the process that has been requested</p>
